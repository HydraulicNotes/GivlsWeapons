Have you ever thought that pointing at enemies until they die was a little bit dull?
Givl's weapons adds several new weapons, which all provide an exciting and engaging experience, beyond what vanilla weapons can.
Look forward to regular updates with new weapons

Now with multiplayer support!*

Weapons:

NEW - Breaker Bullets: Weakens or destroys enemy projectiles

- Rising Flame Arrow: Arrow that shoots a flame upwards on impact
- Tesseraxes: Two axes which you can throw and teleport to at will
- High-Frequency Muramasa: An advanced sword with a custom swing that creates additional slashes to cut enemies again, and can perform a devastating quickdraw attack with its gun-sheath.
- Cross: Constantly damages enemies in a wide area in front of you, but locks your movement while you use it, FAITH-style
- Pentacle Staff: Shoots a pentacle that accelerates to high speeds, and bounces and gains energy when hitting enemies, which will be used to heal you when it touches you.
- Black & White: A pistol that alternates between shooting black and white bullets. If the same color of bullet hits an enemy twice, it will do more damage.

Accessories:

NEW - Chlorophyte Idol: Creates a stationary leaf crystal when hitting an enemy with a true melee attack

- Shield of Discord: Upgrade to Shield of Cthulhu. On hitting an enemy with the dash, teleports you to your cursor. The enemy takes chaos state in your place, and will take the damage as well if either of you has it already.
- Quicksilver Boots: Hermes Boots alt which rapidly restores mana while running.
- Meteor Disk: Creates a burning aura underneath you that restores mana as it damages enemies (Just received a massive buff!)

Potions:

- Cursed Flask: Restores you to full HP instantly. Instead of potion sickness, inflicts potion curse for 20 seconds, which causes you to die in a single hit.


Also adds one meme weapon, try the mod and find out.
